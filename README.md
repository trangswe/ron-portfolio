# Ron the portfolio site

## 🎉 Getting started
- Clone the project to your computer.
- `cd` to the project
- Install all dependencies: `npm install`
- `npm run develop`
- Happy coding!
- Don't worry about my commit messages, things are fixed now and run on my use case. Hope it works for you too.

## 👏 Deploy to Github Page
- This is how it work with my project, maybe it'll work for you as well. But I think you best search "deploy Gatsby site on Github Page" and do as the tutorial teach (that's what I did).
- I made a new branch call "deployment" and set Github Page to deploy from there. Then as I build the website, when ready to deploy, I merge branch master to deployment and run `npm run deploy`. 
- There is a script you have to add somewhere. When you clone this particular project I've already add it so don't worry. But incase it doesn't work, please refer to the tutorial.
