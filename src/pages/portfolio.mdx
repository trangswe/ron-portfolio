# Ron the Portfolio Site - It's an opensouce Gatsby site!

## 1. Features
I want to create a simple website to serve as a CV when applying for jobs. Ron is my favorite character in Harry Potter, and is a great name for anything, right? 

### 1.1 Contents with Markdown
All contents are written in Markdown (like this post you're reading).

### 1.2 Simple and coherent styling
Things load fast (enough). I use monospace font as the main styling point, and I like the color green! 

## 2. Try it out
You can see this website as the demo. [Clone](https://github.com/trang17/trang17.github.io) the project, `npm install` to install dependences and then `gatsby develop`. Or checkout the `readme` for all info needed to get started. Happy coding!
