# Ron the Portfolio Site - It's an opensource Gatsby site!

I want to create a simple website template to serve as a CV when applying for jobs. Ron is my favorite character in Harry Potter, and is a great name for anything, right? 

## Features

### Contents with Markdown
All contents are in Markdown (like this post you're reading!). It's easy and intuitive.

### Simple and coherent styling
Things load fast (enough). I use monospace font as the main styling point, and I like the color green! 

## Try it out
You can see this website as the demo. [Clone](https://github.com/trang17/trang17.github.io) the project, `npm install` to install dependences and then `gatsby develop`. Or checkout the `readme` for all info needed to get started. Happy coding!
