# Harry Styles Live

## Tech stack
HTML, CSS, ReactJS, JestJS, NodeJS, Docker, Netify.

## Features
### Simple and coherent styling.
I wanted to create a simple website, to serve as a CV applying for softwear engineer internship.
Naturally, with a software engineer (wanna-be) mindset, I use monospace font as the main styling point haha. And I like the color green.

### Contents with Markdown
All contents are written in Markdown (like this post you're reading!). And things load fast (enough). My TODO is to make things load faster and have better Lighthouse score. It's okay for now though.

## Try it out
You can see this website as a demo for the theme.

Want to try it out? - [clone](https://github.com/) the project, `cd` to there and `gatsby develop`. Or read the `readme` to have all the info needed to get started.

Happy coding!
