# Like what you see? It's an opensource Gatsby theme.

## Tech stack

HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Gatsby theme.

## Feature
I wanted to create a simple website as a CV applying for softwear engineer internship.
Naturally, with wanna-be-swe mindset, I use monospace font as the main styling point (haha). And I like the color green.

All contents are written with Markdown (this post you're reading is so). And things load fast!

## Try it out
You can see this website as a demo for the theme.

Want to try it out? - [clone](https://github.com/) the project, `cd` to there and `gatsby develop`. Or read the `readme` to have all the info needed to get started.

Happy coding!
