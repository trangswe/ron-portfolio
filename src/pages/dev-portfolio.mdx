# Like what you see? It's an opensource Gatsby theme.

## Tech stack

HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Gatsby theme.

## Features
### Simple and coherent styling.
I wanted to create a simple website, to serve as a CV applying for softwear engineer internship.
Naturally, with a software engineer (wanna-be) mindset, I use monospace font as the main styling point. And I like the color green.

### Markdown magic
All contents are written in Markdown (like this post you're reading!). And things load fast (enough). My TODO is to make things load faster and have better Lighthouse score. It's okay for now though.

## Try it out
You can see this website as a demo for the theme.

Want to try it out? - [clone](https://github.com/) the project, `cd` to there and `gatsby develop`. Or read the `readme` to have all the info needed to get started.

Happy coding!
