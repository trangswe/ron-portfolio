## Info
This is the official [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the ReactJS site.
This was the first project I've done in React.
And if I'm being honest with you I found it sooo hard I wanted to cry.

Cross every finger of mine for that!

## What I've learnt
Passing data through props. And lifting the state up!
