# React is hard. Say it with me: React is hard. And Tic-tac-toe is fun. Or is it?!

## Tech stack
React JS, Netify.

## Info
This is the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the ReactJS site.
This was the first project I've done in React, and it took me quite a while to wrap my head around the way React works (props, states, events, etc). 

I'm working on more projects and the more you do it the easier it gets, right?
Cross my every fingers for that!

## What I've learnt
Passing data through props. And lifting the state up!
