# MIT 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - My Study Notes

## Course info
> "6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language."

Check out [the  course homepage](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/), or my [coding assigment](https://github.com/trang17/MIT-6.0001).

## Coding is hard - and my reason for learning it.
Studying the course is my first experience with programing. And it's so much fun. I don't mean that in an up-beat way though.

## When working in tech, know the fundamentals of programing could never hurt
