# Hufflepuff Project - A Python Testing Project

I studied the course [Automated Software Testing](/automated-software-testing). And though the course is great, its excersises are in Java - the programing language that I don't know.

The good news is that the codes are very readable - I can understand what they do, I just don't know how to write the codes. Granted they are quite simple.

I think to rewrite it in Python - the language I'm more confident with, will be benefitcial.

As this is a Software testing course, not Java programing course after all. And all the testing ideas and concepts carry on no matter the language.

Also, Hufflepuff is the best house change my mind.

## What I've learnt
- Partition and equivalent partitioning
- Boundary testing
- Structure testing and code coverage.
