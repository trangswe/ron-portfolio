# Hufflepuff project - A Python testing project

I studied the course [Automated Software Testing](/automated-software-testing). And though the course is great, its excersises are in Java - the programing language that I know absolutely nothing about.

The good new is that the codes are very readable - I can understand what they do, I just don't know how to write the Java codes.

Granted the codes are quite simple, I think to rewrite it in Python - the language I'm more confident with, will do good.

As this is a Software testing course, not Java programing course after all. And all the testing ideas and concepts carry on no matter the language.

## What I learnt
Using various testing techniques:
- Partition and equivalence partitioning.
- Boundary testing.
- Structure testing and code coverage.
